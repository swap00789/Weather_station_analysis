# Weather_station_analysis
## Temperature recorded by the weather station at the Charlotte/Douglas International Airport.
##### Uses pandas dataframe to create a moving average of the 'actual max temp' subsequently plotting the 'Recorded vs Average Precipitation' and 'Record Min Temp and Record Max Temp with a 7 day Weighted Moving Average'

### The variables are self-explanatory. However, I have added the following data dictionery for better understanding.
